# Implementation Plan

Development Plan for Simple Checklist App

1. Key files to create:
- client/
  - index.html
  - styles.css
  - app.js
  - components/
    - Checklist.js
    - ChecklistItem.js
    - ChecklistForm.js
- server/
  - index.js
  - routes/
    - checklist.js
  - models/
    - Checklist.js
    - ChecklistItem.js
  - config/
    - db.js
- package.json
- README.md

2. Main functions/classes/components to implement:
- Client-side:
  - Checklist component: displays a list of checklist items, handles item status toggling
  - ChecklistItem component: represents a single checklist item, with title and status
  - ChecklistForm component: allows creating a new checklist item
  - App component: top-level component that manages the overall application state
- Server-side:
  - Checklist model: represents the checklist document in the database
  - ChecklistItem model: represents an individual item within a checklist
  - Checklist routes: handle API endpoints for CRUD operations on checklists
  - Database configuration: set up connection to MongoDB database

3. Technology stack:
- Front-end:
  - React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
  - HTML/CSS: markup and styling for the web pages
  - Axios: library for making HTTP requests to the server
- Back-end:
  - Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side development
  - Express.js: web application framework for building APIs
  - MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing checklist data
  - Mongoose: Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB
- Development tools:
  - Git: version control system
  - npm: package manager for installing dependencies
  - Visual Studio Code: code editor

4. High-level architecture diagram (in text):
```
+-----------------+
|    Client       |
|  (React App)    |
+-----------------+
        |
        | HTTP Requests
        |
+-----------------+
|    Server       |
| (Node.js/Express)|
+-----------------+
        |
        | Mongoose ODM
        |
+-----------------+
|    Database     |
|    (MongoDB)    |
+-----------------+
```

The architecture follows a client-server model. The React app running in the browser sends HTTP requests to the server, which is built with Node.js and Express. The server handles the requests, interacts with the MongoDB database using Mongoose, and sends responses back to the client. The database stores the checklist data persistently.

With this plan, you can start by setting up the project structure, installing the necessary dependencies, and then implementing the components, routes, and models. Begin with the basic functionality and then iterate to add more features and polish the user interface.

Remember to handle errors gracefully, validate user inputs, and implement security measures like authentication and authorization as needed. Regularly test your code and commit your progress to version control.
